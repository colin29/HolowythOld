Stats:

Attack, Defense
Power, Stability
Damage, Armor
Accuracy, Dodge {may have a dodging stance (high dodge, low stability)}

Unit A attacks unit B.


Check accuracy against dodge.
-If dodged, no ill effects
-Otherwise, continue.

Compare the attack (summed with the rest of units attacking B)
May result in a full hit, a glancing hit (5% damage), or block:
-On glancing hit or block, check the attack's power against stability somehow. (power multipler of 0.5 if the attack was a glancing hit)
	-If the power is greater than the unit's current stability, that unit becomes off-balance
-On glancing hit or full hit, compare the attack's damage to unit A's armor. (In general, lighter blows are prevented from armor).



(we'll implement glancing blows last)
